# **OverLord**

## Overlord is a dark fantasy anime about a man who is transported to a new, game-like world as his in-game avatar, an powerful undead sorcerer named Ainz Ooal Gown, after the online game he was playing, YGGDRASIL, is shut down. He finds that the NPCs of his guild's headquarters have become sentient, and his new mission is to explore this unfamiliar world and expand his newfound influence and power. The story is about a villain's perspective, as his avatar was a villain in the game, and he takes a similar role in this new world
